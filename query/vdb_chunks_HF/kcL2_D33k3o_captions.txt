hey there guys paul here from the
engineering mindset.com
in this video we're going to be
discussing electrical current
to understand the different types the
symbols used to represent them
how to measure current and how safety
devices are used
to protect us and our electrical
circuits
current is the flow of electrons in a
circuit
to use electricity we need electrons to
flow in the same direction
around a circuit we usually use copper
cables to form the circuit
because copper is a very good electrical
conductor
which means the atoms that make copper
have a loosely bound
electron in their outermost or valence
shell
which is free to move around inside the
metal
this free electron is very easy to move
which is why copper is so popular
it's so easy to move that it will
naturally move two
other copper atoms by itself but this
occurs randomly
in any and all directions which is of no
use to us
we wrap copper wires in rubber because
the rubber is an insulator
which means it does not allow free
electrons to pass through it
that provides a barrier and keeps
electricity within the wires
and away from us for us to use
electricity to power our devices
we need lots of electrons to flow in the
same direction
along a circuit we can then place things
like
lamps in the way of these electrons so
that they have to flow
through it and generate light and heat
in the process
to do this we need to force electrons to
move
and we can do that by applying a voltage
voltage is the pushing force it's like
pressure in a water pipe
the more pressure we have the more water
can flow
the more voltage we have the more
electrons can flow
we can measure pressure without there
being any water flowing
and we can measure voltage without there
being any current flowing
but we can't measure how much water is
flowing
if no water is flowing and we can't
measure the electrical current
if no electrons are flowing if we take a
copper wire
there is no voltage difference between
the two ends
so the free electrons move around
randomly this random movement
is not considered a current but if we
take a battery
of say 1.5 volts and connect the wire
across the two terminals then there is
now a difference of 1.5 volts
across the wire and this difference is
going to force electrons to flow
in the same direction we've covered the
basics of voltage
in detail in our previous video do check
that out links can be found
in the video description down below
so we need a lot of electrons to flow
along a circuit
and through our lamps to get them to
shine brightly
however the cables and lamp can only
handle a certain amount of electrons
passing through them
just like a pipe is rated to handle a
certain amount of water passing through
it
or a certain pressure if it were to
exceed this
then the pipe will just burst likewise
if too many electrons pass through the
cable or the lamp
then they will burst or burn out
we refer to the flow of electrons as
current and we measure this in the unit
of amperes
although you'll usually just hear people
say amps
this is also represented with a capital
a
for example this fuse has a 3 and a
capital a
which means is rated for 3 amps of
current
we'll look at how fuses work a little
later in this video
something that's going to cause you
great confusion when you're learning
about electricity
is the difference between conventional
current and electron flow
these are both theories of how
electricity works
when benjamin franklin was first
experimenting with electricity
he had the idea that something must be
flowing inside the materials
he was given a glass tube and when this
was rubbed with a cloth
it seemed to accumulate this strange
invisible fluid
because when someone else touched the
tube they received a small shock
we now know this as static electricity
but at the time
benjamin franklin assumed that the tube
was accumulating
an excess amount of this invisible fluid
so he considered this to be positive and
the person touching it
must have less of this fluid so they
were considered negative
so he said okay i guess this end is
positive and this end is negative
and electricity flows from positive to
negative
and this does make sense because water
is a fluid
and it flows from a high level to a low
level
soon manufacturers started producing
batteries based on his work
and so they also said well this end is
positive and this end is negative
and we still use this naming convention
to this day
this became known as conventional
current because it's the conventional
theory of how electricity flows
however as science evolved and
experiments became more precise
someone called joseph thompson
discovered that this invisible thing
moving inside the wire was a particle
and he named this particle an electron
he also discovered that these electrons
were actually flowing
in the opposite direction from the
negative to the positive
benjamin franklin didn't realize the
silk cloth was actually removing
electrons from the glass
so they were actually flowing from the
person and
to the glass tube joseph thompson's
theory became known as electron flow
because it's the flow of electrons and
so
what's actually occurring is electrons
are flowing in a circuit
from the negative to the positive
terminal and not the positive to the
negative
however it doesn't really matter what's
moving inside the wire
or in which direction because the
electrical engineering formulas we use
do not take this into account so they
will still come out with the same
answers
it's also a little bit too late now to
change the names of the terminals of all
the batteries in the world
so everyone just kind of ignored this
and we continue to teach and use
conventional current
some books might show you both so you
need to remember that whenever we talk
about electricity
or whenever we design a circuit or even
look at an electrical circuit drawing
we always default and assume
conventional current is occurring
but engineers and scientists know that
the electrons are actually flowing the
other way
if you look on the plugs of your
electrical devices you should find
labels from the manufacturers which tell
you what the product is designed to
handle
for example this laptop charger tells us
that for the device to work
it needs an input of between 100 and 240
volts
and 1.5 amps of aec or alternating
current
which is represented by this symbol here
the charger will then convert this
to give an output of around 19.5 volts
and 3.33 amps of dc or
direct current which is represented by
this symbol
ac and dc are different types of
electricity
the plugs in your homes provide ac or
alternating current
in this type the electrons do not flow
in a continuous loop
instead they alternate between moving
forwards and backwards
just like the tide of the sea your
electrical devices like laptops and
mobile phones
will use dc electricity in this type the
electrons flow
in one direction only directly from one
terminal
to the other you can think of this like
the flow of water down a river
in most cases we transport electricity
from a power station
to the towns and cities using ac
electricity
because it's easy to increase and
decrease the voltage using transformers
and it's also very efficient to
transport electricity
over long distances using this method
however there are a few high voltage dc
transmission lines being used but we
won't go too much into detail on those
we mostly use dc direct current for the
circuit boards of small electronic
devices
like laptops mobile phones and tvs
that's because dc is easier to control
and allow
circuits to be smaller and more compact
many appliances will use a combination
of ac
and dc for example a washing machine
will use
ac for the induction motor which is used
to spin the tub with the clothes in
but the circuit board which controls the
settings the lights the timers
as well as how fast the motor spins will
use dc
power we can convert ac to dc
using a device known as a rectifier this
is extremely common in electronics
we can also convert dc to ac using an
inverter
and this is used for example with solar
power systems we have covered power
inverters in great detail previously
do check that out links can be found in
the video description down below
people often refer to a river or the
tide of the sea
as having a strong current it's very
similar to electricity
a river with a lot of fast flowing water
is said to have a strong current
the same with electricity a cable with a
lot of electrons flowing
also has a high current a river is able
to
handle a certain amount of water flowing
through it
but if more water enters than it can
handle
then the river will burst its banks the
same with electricity
the cable will burst and burn out
manufacturers need to be able to test
cables and lamps
to find out how much current they can
handle
we also want to be able to see how much
current is flowing through our circuits
as well as being able to calculate this
we can measure this using an ammeter
and we measure the flow of current in
the unit of amperes
but you'll usually hear people just
shorten this to amps
so what is an amp one amp is equal to
one coulomb per second
and one coulomb is equal to
approximately six quintillion
242 quadrillion electrons per second
okay but what does that mean another way
to look at this
is that to power this 1.5 watt lamp
with a 1.5 volt battery requires a
current of 1
amp that means that the circuit requires
1 coulomb per second
which means approximately 6 quintillion
242
quadrillion electrons need to flow from
the battery
and through the lamp every second for
the lamp to stay on
but as you can see it's not very
practical to say how many electrons per
second are flowing
so engineers just say amps to save time
the brightness of the lamp will vary
with voltage as we decrease the voltage
there is less pressure pushing the
electrons so less electrons flow as we
increase the voltage
more electrons flow and the lamp shines
brighter
but don't forget at a certain voltage
and current the lamp will burn out
to measure the current in a circuit we
need to connect
an ammeter in series so that the current
flows through it
think of it like a water meter the water
in a pipe needs to flow
through the water meter for us to know
how much water is flowing
likewise we need the electrons to flow
through our ammeter
instead of using an ammeter we're going
to use a multimeter
as we can do a lot more with this device
i'll leave some links in the video
description
down below for where you can pick up a
good multimeter i highly encourage you
to get one of these for your toolkit
they're an essential tool for any
electrical engineer
if we connect this 1.5 volt battery and
this lamp
which has a resistance of 1 ohm then we
get a current reading
of 1.5 amps which means
9 quintillion 636 quadrillion electrons
are flowing
through the lamp every second because
the components of this circuit
are wired in series the current is the
same anywhere in the circuit
so we can take a measurement anywhere
and it's the same value
if we add another lamp to the circuit
connected again in series
and the lamp also has a resistance of 1
ohm then we're adding more resistance to
the circuit
so it's now harder for the electrons to
flow through and so we see a reduction
in current
in this case we get a reading of 0.75
amps
which means 4 quintillion 818
quadrillion electrons are flowing
this circuit is in series so again we
can move the multimeter
and we get the same reading if we now
connect the circuit with two lamps in
parallel
both with a resistance of 1 ohm and
connect this circuit to a battery of 1.5
volts
then in the main wire from and to the
battery we get 3 amps
but on the branch of each lamp we get
1.5 amps
because the path of the electron splits
so they are shared between the two lamps
the path then merges again so we get the
combined total circuit current of 3 amps
because both lamps have the same
resistance they have the same current
but for example if lamp a has a
resistance of 1 ohm
and lamp b has a resistance of 3 ohms
then
in the main wire we get an amp reading
of 2 amps
in the branch for lamp a we get 1.5 amps
and in the branch for lamp b we get 0.5
amps
notice though that length b is dimmer
that's because the resistance is higher
which makes it difficult for electrons
to flow through
in both cases the amps in the branches
all add up
and are equal to the total current
flowing in the main wire
to and from the battery therefore we can
add resistors
to our circuits to restrict how much
current can flow
resistors make it harder for electrons
to flow through a circuit
and that's why we add resistors to the
circuits because they reduce the current
it's like having a kink in a pipe this
will add resistance to the flow of water
which reduces how much water can flow
through and as the water is colliding
with the pipe wall
it's going to lose energy so we get a
pressure drop
the same with a resistor the material
makes it difficult for the electrons to
flow through
the electrons are going to collide and
waste energy
so we get a voltage drop this wasted
energy
needs to go somewhere so it leaves as
heat
if we look at a resistor through a
thermal imaging camera
we can see that heat leaving for example
this led
is rated for a maximum of 22 milliamps
or 0.022 amps we want to connect this to
a 9 volt power supply
if we use a 100 ohm resistor then the
current would be 0.09 amps
which is too much and the led will burn
out if we use a 450 ohm resistor
then the current is 0.02 amps which is
below the limit
so that should be okay if we use a 900
ohm resistor
then the current is 0.01 amps which is
far too low
so the led will not shine brightly when
measuring current in your home
you can also get these fairly cheap
energy meters which allow you to plug
your appliances into it
and this will tell you the voltage the
current the energy consumption
as well as how much it costs to run
these are a great tool to have in your
toolkit
i'll leave a link in the video
description down below for where you can
get one
fuses in a basic sense have a thin piece
of wire inside them
which is rated to handle a certain
amount of current flowing through them
in this case this one is rated to handle
3 amps
or 19 quintillion 272 quadrillion
electrons per second
if too much current flows in the circuit
then the fuse will burn out
and this will open or break the circuit
to protect the expensive electrical
components
the fuse acts as a weak point and is
very cheap to replace
so you can find these mounted on circuit
boards and in the uk
plugs will often have a fuse built in
for added safety
we find circuit breakers in our
electrical panels within our homes and
places of work
circuit breakers are essentially a
switch that automatically opens
to break the circuit if too many
electrons pass through it
in either an overload or a short circuit
scenario
with the overload function if we slowly
add more load to the circuit
we will eventually exceed the rating of
the breaker and it will flip to cut the
power
and protect the circuit this is known as
overload protection
another feature of most modern circuit
breakers
is short circuit protection in this case
if for some reason the positive and the
negative wires
come into direct contact then we see a
very large
and instant surge in current because
there is no resistance
the circuit breaker will detect this
instant surge in current
and will cut the power to cut the
circuit
in north america we find another device
called a gfci
or a ground fault circuit interrupter in
europe this is called an rcd
or residual current device these
basically monitor and compare the
current
in the supply and return wires to a
circuit
if the current coming back is not equal
to the current being supplied
then the electricity has found another
path and is leaving the circuit
it could be passing through a person so
the device cuts the power
this happens extremely fast and with a
very small tolerance
to help protect electric shocks and keep
us safe
